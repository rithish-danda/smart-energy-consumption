# Smart Energy Consumption Project

A data-driven project focused on optimizing energy consumption through thermal image segmentation and lux calibration analysis.

## Overview

This project combines thermal imaging and light intensity analysis to help users understand and optimize their energy consumption patterns. It provides tools for analyzing thermal distributions in spaces and calibrating light measurements for more efficient energy usage.

## Features

- **Thermal Image Segmentation**: Analyzes thermal images to identify heat distribution patterns
- **Lux Calibration**: Tools for calibrating and analyzing light intensity measurements
- **Energy Optimization**: Data-driven insights for reducing energy consumption

## Project Structure

- `thermal-image-segmentaion.ipynb`: Notebook for processing and analyzing thermal images
- `lux_calibration.ipynb`: Notebook containing light intensity calibration procedures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - opencv-python (for image processing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-energy-consumption.git
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
